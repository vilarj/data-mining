Exercise 1: Anomalies
You are working as a data analyst in a bank. The bank has recently
experienced a number of fraudulent credit card transactions. Use
Python and a credit card transaction dataset (which includes columns
such as transaction time, amount, cardholder name, and whether the
transaction is fraudulent or not) to identify anomalous transactions
that might be fraudulent. Use an anomaly detection algorithm of your
choice (like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, or any other suitable
method). Provide the Python code and a brief explanation of your
approach and results.
